# 🪞 Project Reflection

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building the *FuelEU Maritime Compliance Platform*, I learned how to structure a real-world full-stack app using **Hexagonal Architecture**.  
This project pushed me to separate business logic (core) from infrastructure and adaptors, which made the entire backend extremely clean and testable.

Working with **AI tools (GPT-5, Cursor Agent, Copilot)** taught me how to use them as coding assistants — not as “do-everything bots”.  
I learned how to:
- Write detailed prompts for high-quality, framework-agnostic code.
- Verify ORM migrations, data models, and connection flows.
- Handle real-world debugging (Prisma + PostgreSQL + Vite).

## ⚡ Efficiency Gains

Without AI, setting up a full hexagonal Node + React + Prisma project would easily take 4–5 days.  
With AI help, I was able to:
- Generate 80% of boilerplate in <1 hour.
- Fix Prisma and TypeScript configuration issues in minutes.
- Auto-document my workflow and generate consistent Markdown files.

The biggest time saver was **contextual debugging** — I pasted error messages into GPT-5 and instantly got clear, working fixes.

## 🧩 What Didn’t Work Perfectly

- Some AI outputs had wrong import paths or outdated Prisma syntax.
- I had to manually fix inconsistent case-sensitive file imports in React.
- Cursor sometimes generated duplicate folders — required manual cleanup.
- Testing stubs generated by AI lacked assertions, so I wrote them myself.

Despite these, AI tools made the overall workflow faster and more productive.

## 🚀 What I’d Improve Next Time

1. Containerize everything (Docker Compose for backend + frontend).
2. Add proper CI/CD with automated Prisma migrations.
3. Integrate chart visualizations using Recharts for CompareTab.
4. Deploy to Render + Neon DB for a cloud-hosted demo.

## 🧭 Personal Reflection

As a final-year engineering student, this project helped me realize how AI can turn a single developer into a full-stack team.  
I didn’t just “copy-paste” AI code — I learned to **direct AI intelligently**, debug efficiently, and build production-level logic end-to-end.

This experience gave me more confidence in using AI as a **co-engineer** rather than just a chatbot.  
Now, I can structure scalable projects faster and explain my reasoning clearly — both technically and architecturally.
